%% Linear Transport System
% 
% This example shows a linear transport system often used in manufacturing
% lines.  Linear motors drive movers along a track to specified positions.
% Point-on-Curve Constraints are used to constrain the movement of the
% mover to the track.  The geometry, spline of the track, and specified
% stopping positions are parameterized using MATLAB, making it easy to
% reconfigure the system.

%% Conveyor 1 Subsystem
%
% The system is composed of one rail and two movers.  A mechanical
% reference and a spline defining the path of the rail connect the
% components in the system.

%% Mover 1 Subsystem
%
% Each mover is controlled independently.  The control system tells the
% mover to which station it should go.  Its x and y position are converted
% to the nearest station number so that the motion control subsystem can
% tell the mover when to move and stop.

%% Mover Subsystem
%
% The mover must be constrained to the spline defining the rail such that
% it follows the rail with a specific orientation.  Two Point on Curve
% constraints ensure that its axis is aligned with the rail, and the Planar
% Joint ensures that it does not rotate about the rail.

%% Rail Subsystem
%
% The rail is defined by a series of straight and curved extrusions.  Their
% lengths and arcs are parameterized so that the track can be modified
% using MATLAB variables.
