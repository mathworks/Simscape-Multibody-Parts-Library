%% Lead Screw with Friction
% 
% This example models a lead screw with friction. The constraint force in
% the lead screw is measured and used to calculate the friction torque
% within the lead screw. A continuous stick-slip friction model is used to
% determine the coefficient of friction based on the relative rotational
% speed of the two parts connected by the lead screw.

%% Lead Screw Friction Subsystem
%
% This subsystem calculates and applies the friction torque to the two
% parts connected by the lead screw joint. The following free-body diagram
% shows the relevant parameters and forces acting on the system.
%
% <<sm_lead_screw_friction_force_diagram.png>>
%
% The friction equation is:
% 
% $Torque_{friction} = F_{load} \cdot r_{screw} \cdot \mu$ 
%
% If $\mu > tan(\lambda)$, the lead screw is non-backdriveable.  Applying
% an axial load force will not be sufficient to permit the lead screw to
% move.
