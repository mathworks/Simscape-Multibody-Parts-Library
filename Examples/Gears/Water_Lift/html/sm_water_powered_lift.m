%% Water Powered Lift
%
% This example models a water powered mechanical lift.  Water flowing from
% a spout fills a bucket that is on the end of an arm.  When the bucket is
% full, its weight causes it to drop, moving it away from the spout.  A
% hole in the bottom of the bucket allows the water to drain.  As the water
% drains, the bucket becomes lighter and a spring rotates the arm so that
% the bucket is back under the spout.
%
% The bucket is connected via a one-way clutch and a bevel gear to a lead
% screw.  The lead screw is non-backdriveable. This combination of
% mechanical elements enables the pouring water to lift a mechanical load.
%
% This example uses a the General Variable Mass block from Simscape
% Multibody to model the varying mass, inertia, and center of gravity
% location in each bucket.

%% Spout Subsystem
%
% This subsystem models the spout and provides a visual cue that the water
% is flowing.  A pressure source models the hydraulic head.  A Simulink
% signal controls the opening of a valve and the movement of the visual cue
% in the Simscape Multibody animation.

%% Arm and Bucket with General Variable Mass
%
% The General Variable Mass block is used to model the varying mass,
% inertia, and location of the center of gravity within each bucket.  These
% quantities vary as the buckets are filled from the source and drain
% through the hole in their base.  The angle of the bucket is used to
% determine if the buckets are underneath the spout.

%% Calculate Water Volume Subsystem
%
% This subsystem calculates the volume of water in the bucket.  The
% Interval Test block is used to determine if the bucket is under the
% spout. If so, it is assumed the bucket gets all the water coming from the
% spout. 
%
% The rate of water leaving the bucket depends on the height of the water
% in the bucket and the size of the hole in the bucket.  They are related
% by the following equation:
% 
% $Q_{out} = Area_{hole} \cdot (2 \cdot gravity \cdot height_{water})^{1 / 2}$
%
% Integrating the net flow rate into the bucket allows us to calculate the
% volume of water in the bucket. The Integrator is limited to ensure that
% the volume of the water does not go below zero and does not exceed the
% size of the bucket.
% 
% Because the area of the bucket does not vary with its height, we can
% simply divide by the area of the bucket to get the height of the water in
% the bucket.  More complex formulas or a lookup table could be used if the
% bucket had a more complex shape.

%% Calculate Mass and Inertia Subsystem
%
% This subsystem prepares the inputs for the General Variable Mass block.
% It is important to know the location and orientation of the frame to
% which this block is attached, for it governs these calculations. The
% frame is attached at the center of floor of the bucket with the z-axis
% pointing up.
%
% The mass is simply the volume times the density. Since the bucket is
% symmetrical, the only non-zero component for the center of gravity is the
% z-axis which is half of the height of the water. The inertia tensor is
% calculated for a square beam:
%
% $I_{x} = I_{y} = mass \cdot (width^2+height^2)/12$ 
%
% $I_{z} = mass \cdot (width^2+length^2)/12$

%% Mechancial Arm Subsystem
%
% This subsystem models one of the arms on the water wheel.  It consists of
% six rigid parts - the spoke, bracket arc, bracket sides, and the pins
% that attach to the bucket.  Though it is modeled using six separate Solid
% blocks and a number of Rigid Transform blocks, it is treated as a single
% solid part by Simscape Multibody.  A few of the solids, such as Bracket
% Arc, have multiple ports.  Solids with multiple ports have frame
% definitions within the Solid block itself.

%% One-Way Clutch Subsystem
%
% This subsystem models one-way clutch connecting the arm to the gear. A
% Revolute Joint provides a degree of freedom, and a torque is applied to
% the joint so that the relative velocity can only be negative.  This is a
% very simple model of a one-way clutch. Increasing the gain between
% rotational speed and torque will permit less slip between the shafts but
% will also make the model more numerically stiff.

%% Bevel Gear Subsystem
%
% This subsystem models the bevel gear that connects the output shaft of
% the one-way clutch to the lead screw.  Two Revolute Joints and Bevel Gear
% Constraint are required to constrain the two gears in this assembly.  The
% Bevel Gear Constraint and Rigid Transform are parameterized so that the
% frames are positioned and oriented as required by the Bevel Gear
% Constraint block.

%% Lead Screw Subsystem
%
% This subsystem models the lead screw. It uses the Lead Screw Joint in
% Simscape Multibody and has an additional subsystem that models stick-slip
% friction within the Lead Screw Joint.  The default values of the friction
% model make the lead screw non-backdriveable, as the tangent of the lead
% angle is less than the coefficient of friction.  The one-way clutch
% ensures that the drive gear spins only in one direction, and the
% non-backdriveable lead screw ensures that the load will not lower due to
% its own weight.  This combination makes it possible for the arm to raise
% the load.
