%% Cable-Driven XY Table with Cross Base
% 
% This examples models an XY positioning table that uses a cable-driven
% mechanism.  A single cable wraps around 7 different pulleys
% and converts the rotational angle of the two input pulleys to the x-y
% position of the table.
%
% Inverse kinematics can be used to map table position to pulley angle. The
% model allows you to specify the motion of the table in x-y coordinates
% and determine the required pulley rotation to produce that movement.
% Inverse dynamics can be used to calculate the torque required to produce
% that motion.

%% Platform Subsystem
%
% This subsystem models the platform that has two degrees of freedom.  The
% slider and the table are constrained by two prismatic joints which permit
% movement along two perpendicular axes.  The mounting points for all seven
% pulleys are defined in this subsystem.

%% Pulleys Subsystem
%
% This subsystem models the seven pulleys which are connected by a single
% cable.  The pulley constraints and the cable connections ensure that the
% rotation of the individual pulleys follows the kinematic behavior as
% specified in the diagram.  The cable ends attach to points on the upper
% part of the platform.

%% Motion Subsystem
%
% This subsystem shows the inputs that can be used to prescribe the motion
% of the table.  The upper set of inputs prescribes the motion of the table
% in x-y coordinates, and an inverse kinematic simulation can determine the
% required rotations of pulleys 2 and 6 to achieve that movement.  The
% lower set of inputs prescribe the angles of pulleys 2 and 6.  This data
% was recorded from the inverse kinematic simulation.
