Simscape Multibody Parts Library (Second Generation technology)

This set of examples shows you how to create parameterized parts for Simscape Multibody, and example MATLAB scripts 
for defining general extrusions.  To get started, run startup_Parts_Lib.m

Key parts of this submission:

1. The Extrusion_Scripts subdirectory contains example MATLAB functions for defining extrusions.
   Run them with no arguments to get a plot of the 2-D shape and parameters.
   Use them in your Simscape Multibody models with numeric parameters to create complex shapes

2. The Libraries subdirectory contains a library file with parameterized parts.
   Look at these examples to see how you can create parameterized parts in Simscape Multibody

3. The Models subdirectory has a some example models built using the parameterized parts.
