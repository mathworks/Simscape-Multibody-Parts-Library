%% Simscape Multibody Parts Library: Gear Assemblies
% 
% The gear constraint blocks require that other constraints in the
% mechanism correctly position and orient the frames associated with the
% gear constraint.  The library blocks group the required blocks together
% and parameterize them so that frames are always in the right place.
% There are many ways they can be combined, this library shows you one way
% to do it.
